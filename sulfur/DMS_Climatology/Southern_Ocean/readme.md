Scripts included here generate a boreal summertime DMS climatology for the Southern Ocean, using ensembled random forest regression (RFR) and artificial neural network algorithms (ANN).

The main scripts include: 
* SO_DMS_build_models.py: main script processing/interpolating data and building the RFR and ANN ensembles.
* SO_DMS_analysis.py: main script for analysis, with code computing flux calculations and generating figures.

See "Ancillary_Scripts" for subfunctions producing processing steps applied to predictor data, sea-air flux calculations, the neural network design, and mapping templates. 

All observational DMS data can be found in the NOAA PMEL repository (https://saga.pmel.noaa.gov/dms/).
